## Versioning & Releasing

Increments in the version should be done by one of the project owners.

The version should follow the standard `major.minor.patch` style, see http://semver.org/ for which defines the specification. The examples below are a paraphrasing of that specification.

# Examples of changes that would warrant a `patch` version changes

* Small changes that are completely backwards compatible, normally bug fixes.
* changes in dependencies

# Examples of changes that would warrant a `minor` version changes

* Introduction of new functionality, without breaking backwards compatibility.

# Examples of changes that would warrant a `major` version changes

* Any break in backwards compatibility must result in an increment of the `major` version.
